class SpotifyVisualizer:
    """A class that allows for multi-threaded music visualization via the Spotify API, a Raspberry Pi, and an LED
    strip.

    This code was developed and tested using a 240-pixel (4 meter) Adafruit Dotstar LED strip, a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
    and my personal Spotify account. After initializing an instance of this class, simply call visualize() to begin
    visualization (alternatively, simply run this module). Visualization will continue until the program is interrupted
    or terminated. There are 4 threads: one for visualization, one for periodically syncing the playback position with
    the Spotify API, one for loading chunks of track data, and one to periodically check if the user's current track has
    changed.

    Currently, loudness and pitch data are used to generate and display visualizations on the LED strip. Loudness is
    used to determine how many pixels to light (growing from the center of the strip towards the ends). At any given
    moment, the lit part of the strip is segmented into 12 equal-length zones (one zone for each of the 12 major pitch
    keys). Each zone fades from start_color to its corresponding end color in end_colors. If the pitch key corresponding
    to a zone is very strong (high presence), that zone will be set to its end color. If the pitch key corresponding to
    a zone is very weak, then the zone will be set to start_color. If the pitch key corresponding to a zone is of
    intermediate strength, then the zone will be set to a color value between start_color and its end color.
    Additionally, A fade effect is applied to the ends of each zone; the color of the middle pixel of a zone will be set
    purely based on the strength of the corresponding pitch. Pixels towards the end of each zone, however, will fade
    back towards start_color.

    Args:
        num_pixels (int): The number of pixels (LEDs) supported by the LED strip.

    Attributes:
            buffer_lock (threading.Lock): a lock for accessing/modifying the interpolated function buffers.
            data_segments (list): data segments to be parsed and analyzed (fetched from Spotify API).
            end_colors (dict): a dict of 12 RGB 3-tuples; maps pitch zone indices to the end-gradient-color of the zone.
            interpolated_loudness_buffer (list): producer-consumer buffer holding interpolated loudness functions.
            interpolated_pitch_buffer (list): producer-consumer buffer holding lists of interpolated pitch functions.
            num_pixels (int): the number of pixels (LEDs) on the LED strip.
            permission_scopes (str): a space-separated string of the required permission scopes over the user's account.
            playback_pos (float): the current playback position (offset into track in seconds) of the visualization.
            pos_lock (threading.Lock): a lock for accessing/modifying playback_pos.
            should_terminate (bool): a variable watched by all child threads (child threads exit if set to True).
            sp_gen (Spotify): Spotify object to handle main thread's interaction with the Spotify API.
            sp_load (Spotify): Spotify object to handle data loading thread's interaction with the Spotify API.
            sp_skip (Spotify): Spotify object to handle skip detection thread's interaction with the Spotify API.
            sp_sync (Spotify): Spotify object to handle synchronization thread's interaction with the Spotify API.
            sp_vis (Spotify): Spotify object to handle visualization thread's interaction with the Spotify API.
            start_color (tuple): a 3-tuple of ints for the RGB value representing the start color of the pitch gradient.
            strip (APA102): APA102 object to handle interfacing with the LED strip.
            track (dict): contains information about the track that is being visualized.
            track_duration (float): the duration in seconds of the track that is being visualized.
